# Contributing

Although the current form of this project is a set of OpenRocket parts files, as the research has progressed
it has become a significant resource cataloging historical and current sport rocket vehicle parts.
Anyone who has relevant knowledge, expertise or specific information is encouraged to contribute.
The long term goal is to reduce actual errata to almost nil, with uncertain or disputed information clearly
marked as such.

This project follows the standard GitHub model for contribution:  please fork the repo, make and test your changes,
and then submit a pull request.  If you are adding new entries, please try to follow in detail the format of
existing material, as this will simplify future automated processing.

If you see a problem but don't know how or where it should get fixed, please file a GitHub issue in the project.
This would also be a good way to provide general information that doesn't seem to have a specific home in the
data files yet.
